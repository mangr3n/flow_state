# Project Idea

## Core Concept
Intelligent chaining of LLM calls leads to higher quality outcomes. We will port the AlphaCodium implementation (available in ./reference/AlphaCodium) to Elixir, making it available as a library for other applications.

## Goal
Create an Elixir library that implements intelligent LLM call chaining based on the AlphaCodium approach.
